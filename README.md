# Randomly Generated Websites Repository

Welcome to the Dump repository! This repository is where I upload my randomly generated websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gaureshpai/dump.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd dump
    ```

3. Open any of the generated websites in your browser:
    - Open `index.html` in your browser to view the main page.
    - Explore other HTML files in the repository for more generated websites.

## What's Inside

This repository contains the following files and directories:
- `files`: individual files that have all the dump websites of mine
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the default website inside the file.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the websites individually.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the websites.
- `assets/`: Directory containing any additional assets such as images or fonts used in the websites.

Feel free to explore and modify the files to create your own randomly generated websites!
